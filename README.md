EXACT ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS OF THE ESTIMATES OF MULTIVARIATE REGRESSIONS WITH OMITTED VARIABLES: A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK APPROACH

In this paper, we investigate several parametric, nonparametric and semi-parametric estimators’ explicit asymptotic biases attributed to the endogeneity caused by omitting variables in multivariate regressions. A
unified framework to derive and compare these asymptotic biases are proposed, explicit estimations of
these asymptotic biases can be then identified. The conditions are given out where the asymptotic bias of
the Nadaraya-Watson’s estimation of the nonparametric model is smaller than that of the least-squared
estimation of the parametric linear model, and where the asymptotic bias of the Robinson’s estimation of
the partial linear model is smaller than that of the linear model. It is shown that the condition for the Robinson’s estimator to dominate the OLS is weaker than the condition for the Nadaraya-Watson’s estimator to dominate the OLS, and the partial linear model’s IV estimation has a faster convergent speed
to the true parameter value than the linear model as the partial linear model’s IV estimation owns a smaller
finite sample bias when dealing with omitted variables. Asymptotic biases of some other nonparametric
estimators are also derived and compared under this framework where some explanatory variables are omitted. We show that the asymptotic bias of the Gasser-Müller’s estimator is smaller than that of the Nadaraya-Watson’s estimator, and the asymptotic bias of the local linear estimator is the same as that of
the Gasser-Müller’s estimator. In addition, regressions in which there are some explanatory variables omitted and in which there are location shifts in the endogenous regressors (Phillips and Liangjun Su, 2011) are also studied under this framework. We find that all the estimators are consistent without instrument variables and the nonparametric estimators with location shifts will always dominate the ones without
location shifts under a weaker assumption. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the finite sample performances of these proposed properties
